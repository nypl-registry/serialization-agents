Aggregates agents from sources systems and serializes them into lookup table and triple store.



####lib/utils.js
Basic methods for looking up agents in viaf lookup table and agents ingest table

####lib/utils_shadowcat.js
Methods specific to looking up/building agent model from shadowcat `'sc:agents'` field

`shadowcatSerializeViafAgents` - Builds/merges agents in shadowcat that were mapped to a VIAF identifier.	

`removeViafFromShadowcatAgent` - If a VIAF id is not valid (deleted cluster, not lcnaf useInstead) we will set the 'sc:agents'.viaf to false so it can be processed in the uncontrolled workflow.

`shadowcatSerializeNonViafAgents` - Builds/merges agents in shadowcat that were not mapped to a VIAF id. This process runs after the VIAF to allow matching of alt forms to controlled terms already in the agents collection.
